# Simple-Blockchain

My implementation of a blockchain in Java. It follows the Bitcoin blockchain principles such as SHA256 to headers and blocks,
merkle trees, and the ability to "mine" data into blocks.

Peer to peer network is a work-in-progress.

### Requirements
Uses java 10.0.1, Java.net library, and Google Gson library(jar file inside of directory lib)
